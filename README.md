# Baseline correction via Adaptive Smoothness Penalized Least Squares
The **asPLS** (*Adaptive Smoothness Penalized Least Squares*) algorithm is a method to remove spurious baseline trends that might be present in timeseries data. It is especially useful in the context of peak detection, where spurious trends can completely break the identification and analysis.
This repository proposes a Matlab implementation of asPLS based in the [original paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00387010.2020.1730908) by Zhang et al. [1]
